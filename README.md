Learning React Basics:

- React is the most popular JS library which is used to build independent UI components that can be reused. 

- React apps are a tree of components.

- React Component consists of a class, a state and a render method. State has the data we want to display and render has the display instructions. 

- The output of a render method is a react element, which is a JS object that maps the DOM elements. 

- React works with a virtual DOM. React maintains the Real DOM by checking the virtual DOM and make changes accordingly. Maintaining a virtual DOM is cheap to create. 
  - The benefit of this is we don't have to attach event handlers and stuff. It is called React because it reacts to the state change.
